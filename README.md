# Regex-validation
A simple code trying to validate a string based on a regex (in simple manners)

The string can contain the English alphabet, while the regex can contain the English alphabet, "*" (which can be replaced by anything,
including an empty string, and "?" which can be replaced with exactly one of the English alphabet by choice.

No regex libraries were used in this code
